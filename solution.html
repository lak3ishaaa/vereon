<h1>🌟 Solution: Vereon</h1>
<p>
To solve the problem of impersonation and unauthorized access during exams, 
VEREON uses smart facial recognition technology 👁️‍🗨️ to create a reliable and easy-to-use access control system 🔐. </p>

<p>This system helps exam invigilators 🧑‍🏫 quickly and accurately confirm the identity of each registered candidate before they take the test 📝.
 By doing this, VEREON ensures that only the right people are allowed to sit for the exams, 
 reducing cheating and making the process more secure ✅.</p>

<p>Traditional methods like checking ID cards 🪪 can be slow and are sometimes not enough to catch impersonators. 
 VEREON improves this by using facial recognition to verify each person in real time ⏱️. 
This saves time, reduces mistakes ❌, and increases trust in the exam process 🤝.</p>
